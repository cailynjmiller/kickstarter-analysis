# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## This is an analysis of a dataset of both successful and non-successful kickstarter campaigns across a variety of different industries, budgets, and timeframes in order to uncover trends as to what makes a successful campaign.
### This chart shows the breakdown of successful, failed, cancelled, and live campaigns across all categories.

This chart shows us that the biggest cateogry in this dataset is Theater and, although there are a lot of entries of successful campaigns, the failure rate is higher in this category than others.
### This chart shows the breakdown of successful, failed, cancelled, and live campaigns based on the launch month of the campaign.<br/>

This chart shows us that campaigns launched in the summer months May-August tended to be the most successful. We know this because the number of successful campaigns increases during this time at a higher rate than failing campaigns do.
